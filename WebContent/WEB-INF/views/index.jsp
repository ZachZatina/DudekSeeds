			<h1 align="center">Welcome to Dudek Seeds</h1>
			<p>Thank you for visiting our internet site. We are currently offering open 
			pollinated seed corn for sale. Our open pollinated corn is our very own variety 
			we call Tommy Boy. It is a 89 day maturity dual purpose(silage, grain) and can be 
			a great option for some.  Dudek seed corn can be expected to top out near 
			130-150bpa. It will be of higher protein content than hybrids.  Most modern 
			gmo(rr, bt, ll, traited) corn is near or under 7%, open pollinated runs between 9-11%. 
			 As silage expect it to have 5% less tonnage per acre but will have higher tdn.</p>
			 <br>
			<p>We recomend planting at 26k per acre for grain and 30-33k for silage.  Soil fertility should
			be targeted for 120 bushel corn as open pollinated is a better "feeder".  We do not reccomend 
		 	heavier fertilization.</p>
			<br>
		 	<p>Seed will be available in 80k bags(approx 55lbs) 5lb plot bags and 1lb garden size.  
		 	Seed is untreated and can be treated for additional cost. Order early and pay early discounts.

		 	<h2 align="center">About Open Pollinated Seeds</h2>
		 	<br>
		 	<p>Open pollinated is all that was planted prior to hybrids.  Open pollinated is the 
		 	grandparent genetics to all our hybrids we currently have.  Open pollinated genetics 
		 	have been changed dramatically in the last 10 years.  It has increased yields and 
		 	standability.  Open pollinated is best suited for marginal soils or areas of weather 
		 	stress.  Do not expect open pollinated to compare to triple stack hybrids in good soil. 
		 	It is very drought tolerant and has a longer pollination window compared to hybrids.  
		 	If you have tough soils or weather open pollinated may be your best option. </p>
